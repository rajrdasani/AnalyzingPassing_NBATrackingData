Abstract:
In the game of basketball, the success of a possession hinges not just on the quality of a shot but also on the quality of the preceding passes. Although much research has been done modeling the expected outcome of a shot, much less is devoted to the value added from a pass. This paper attempts to bridge that gap by offering an Expected Assists model. Using publicly available tracking data from the 2015-16 NBA season, we employ a combination of a rules-based approach and a Generalized Additive Model to identify when a pass occurs. Due to heavy computational limitations, our research concentrates on all Los Angeles Clippers games from December 2015. We then develop a shot model that projects the chance of a player making a shot given his location and the defense around him. We incorporate this into a passing model that takes into consideration the timing and location in order to create an expected points added metric for each pass. This metric allows us to identify passers who are creating good shooting opportunities for their teammates without penalizing them when their teammates are unable to convert. Isolating an individual playerâ€™s play-making from team success is a key component of equitable player evaluation.
